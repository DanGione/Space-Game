# Space-Game
A little physics-based game I made in Unity on a whim

**DOWNLOAD SPACE GAME.ZIP AND UNZIP IT TO A FOLDER! IGNORE THE REST OF THE FILES IN HERE!!**

**Escape exits the game**

Use A and D to rotate the ship and the spacebar to propel yourself forward!
After landing on objects, you can get a boost when taking off **OR** you can press left shit to visit the surface!
The only object you can visit the surface of currently is the big planet.

Once on the surface, use A and D to move left and right and press space to jump.
If you wish to return to space simply press left shift while in front of the space ship.


Hope you enjoy!

P.S. Remember that escape exits the game!
