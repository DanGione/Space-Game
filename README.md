# Space-Game
A little physics-based game I made in Unity on a whim

**DOWNLOAD SPACE-GAME.ZIP AS IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL RUN PROPERLY!!**

**Escape exits the game**

Use A and D to rotate the ship and the spacebar to propel yourself forward!
After landing on objects, you can get a boost when taking off!

Hope you enjoy!

P.S. Remember that escape exits the game!
